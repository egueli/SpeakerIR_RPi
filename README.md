The `tm1637.py` file is copied from https://github.com/SimonStJG/raspberrypi-tm1637/tree/master. Why use that version instead of the original tm1637 library https://pypi.org/project/raspberrypi-tm1637/ ? Because for some reason, the underlying wiringpi library conflicts with GPIOs when used as input devices (evdev), while the gpiozero library used by that version doesn't cause any conflict.
